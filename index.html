                    <p class="skill-description">HTML is a standardised system for tagging text files that creates the structure for just about every page that we find and use on the web. It's HTML that adds in page breaks, paragraphs, bold lettering, italics, and more. HTML works to build this structure by using tags that tell browsers what to do with text.</p>

                    <p class="skill-description">CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.</p>
